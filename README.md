### Variables and Data Types

!!!Replace with a summary and examples of how multiple variables have been used with a variety of data types and why they have been used effectively and appropriately!!!

### Console Input and Output

I used cout to give the user instructions and cin to make the decisions from the users input.

### Decisions

I used char to make a yes or no decision for when the user enters something that does not exist. 

### Iteration

iteration was used in this project to make sure that the user gets their input in on purpose.
